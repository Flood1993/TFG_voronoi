# Adjusting a partition of the plane through Voronoi diagrams

The aim of this project is to study and design strategies for adjusting a given partition of the square unit through Voronoi diagrams.

Since checking the whole search space is not doable, we will be using and comparing different techniques: the "gradient method" and the "simulated annealing technique".
